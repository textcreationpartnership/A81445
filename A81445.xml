            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>What, you was one of those scurvy Fellows who could get none of my Favours, though I was very liberal of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rail at me.</p>

                  <speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
                  <p>No: I was one of those scurvy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows who knew 'twas in vain to hope for any Woman, and therefore hated you all before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; and had shewn my Malice, if your self and Lovers had not spared me the pains, in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Praises without me.</p>

                  <speaker>Aesop.</speaker>
                  <p>No: A great many did like you, and some were out of my reach, so that not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where to fix, I applied my self to Birds and Beasts that did not vex me.</p>

                  <p>Thou mightest pass for a Wit among Birds and Beasts, but thou wast a very foolish Fellow among Women if there were any in thy time like me; for thou wouldst have helpt to encrease the train of Lovers, and be kindly used too, rather than lessen the Equipage.</p>

                  <p>Nothing is ever hateful to Women of my Sort, but what does not admire us; nor any thing lovely but our selves.</p>

                  <p>Then every thing that deserves to be valued, goes without it among you, and the most nauseous Part of the Creation is only loved; yet I am pleased with thee too, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if it were possible a greater Contradiction to Love then my self, which I did not think there could be.</p>

                  <p>I am a parcel of Atoms that jumbled together by chance, and as you see formed a certain two-legged Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, but a very considerable One for all that; the greatest Philosopher that ever was.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135738:8"/>Policy that looks very strange to me, That you who had no Religion, must all of a sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy your great Favour with the King, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring so fiercely against Popery, which you knew he had a Mind should be quiet?</p>

                  <speaker>Shaftsb.</speaker>
                  <p>I had my Reasons to desire being the Rabbles God, and there was no way like that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>You might have made a Noise against Popery, and pleased the Rabble without losing the King by inventing that persecuting Test.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Shaftsb.</speaker>
                  <p>No, I could do no good with the Rabble, while they had a good Opinion of the Gentry and Nobility, which I durst not attempt to take off, by speaking publickly against them, and therefore was fain to devise this Test to make them suspect them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I can't understand how it could hurt any but those who could not take it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Shaftsb.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, it made People believe, that I who was known to have a Reach beyond the Common, found a general Inclination to Popery among them, when I thought there was need of exacting Oaths against it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>What do you make then of Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Oaths?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Shaftsb.</speaker>
                  <p>The Nature of the Thing requires it; but whosoever advises a King to Impose new ones, has a mind to have his Subjects believe he suspects them to be leaning to what they are required to Renounce; for People are never required to forswear what they hate, every one knowing that Nature is instead of a thousand Oaths in making them forbear it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Your Kings do not use to devise new Oaths, but your Parliaments impose new ones upon themselves.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Shaftsb.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis a sign then, that they suspect themselves to want Courage, if not Will to refuse what they Renounce, without it; did you ever hear of any that forswore what they have no Inclination to? Does a Spendthrift ever forswear Hoarding, or an Old Mizer throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away his Money? Did ever any that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver toutch't a Card, forswear them? And how many that love them too well, do, to keep their Companions from the Solicitations which they fear should prevail?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, you compast your End; you made the Subjects suspect one another by your Test, and the King hateful to them all by shutting up the <hi>Exchequer;</hi> but pray what was the End of all this?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Shaftsb.</speaker>
                  <p>That wearied out with Troubles, Divisions and Mismanagements, they might find the Want of so wise a Head as mine, and chuse me for King.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>O abominable! 'Tis pity but the King had known all this, when he heapt his Favours upon you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Shaftsb.</speaker>
                  <p>Why do you make such an outcry at me? Is it not the Fashion of all Favourites to give the Advice which they think most for their own Profit, without caring one Farthing whether they Ruin their Master or no?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>Then all Favourites are Fools; do they not commonly fall with them, sometimes first; and if they escape both, did ever any of them rise upon their Master's Ruine, as I did upon the Greatness of mine, which I took such pains to procure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Shaftsb.</speaker>
                  <p>It is not to be denied; however the Favourites come not to follow your Steps:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135738:9"/>but methinks as clear as your Sight was, you did not give your Kings a true Idea of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for a Government which lies all in a single Man's humour, must certainly Ruine the Subject: And however Kings come not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it till 'tis too late, their Greatness rises, sinks, and perishes, with the Prosperity of their People.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Rich.</speaker>
                  <p>I did not form that Government as the best; but it was the best I could introduce then there; for one Arbitrary Prince was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Hundreds, which was the Case then in <hi>France,</hi> every Nobleman being so: And I could not take away part of their Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking all, for there is no doubt if it could have been done, but your Constitution is best for King as well as People.</p>

                  <p>He has not only made her in Love, but in such Distress for a Husband, that when she was croft in him she loved, she is resolved to have one however, and gives her Hand to <hi>Alexander,</hi> while the imaginary Hero has her Heart.</p>

                  <p>'Tis barbarous beyond Expression in him; but let her defend her own Quarrel, I have enough to do with my own.</p>

                  <speaker>Clelia.</speaker>
                  <p>No where, if it had been True; but your confounding my glorious Action with so many Lies, may make that question'd as well as the rest.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scudery.</speaker>
                  <p>By that Rule all Actions that ever have been done, Good, Bad, or Indifferent, may be question'd as well as yours; for they are told
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135738:10"/>with as many Additions and Alterations as they pass through Hands.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clelia.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis much to the purpose to do great Actions then, if they are subject to so many Misrepresentations.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scudery.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, if they are done only for Vanity, they may chance miss their Aim; though a clear Understanding will generally guess pretty right through all the Mists that are raised about them.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clelia.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Scudery.</speaker>
                  <p>From the Character of those they are told of, and that of those that tell them; though I generally judge most of the Teller, by the Story; for most People draw their own Picture upon it: In a Cobler's Hands it shall have the Air of a Cobler; in a Market-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's, of a Market-Woman.</p>

                  <p>But my Story is in no danger of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into such Hands now; for being only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in History, and your Romance, they will never hear of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Scudery.</speaker>
                  <p>O, you are in a great Mistake, for the Souls of a great many Market-Women in former days are got into Ladies in these; and all the Mean, the Spiteful, the Ridiculous Chat that was confin'd to the Market in your time, helps People to talk now, that must be silent else; nay, and makes them pass for good Company too with those that are not above their pitch.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clelia.</speaker>

                  <p>No, there is variety now, as there was always; and you may expect Justice in some places.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Clelia.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Scudery.</speaker>
                  <p>Because they put themselves in the places of them they speak of, and tell what they would have done if they had been there; if it falls into witty Hands, they will find a witty Meaning where perhaps there was none; if into filly ones, 'tis all over Nonsense and Folly immediately, let them have never so much Wit that acted it.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Well, provided I have the Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on my side, the rest may do what they will; And none but Fools as great as they that tell them, will hearken to the others, because there is no diversion in them.</p>

                  <p>O, I have heard of you before, and thought you had been deserving enough not to need being your own Trumpeter?</p>

                  <p>You are in the right, I was deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enough, to have had all the World for my Trumpeters, if I had lived in an Age when Merit would hire any; but I did not, and therfore was forced to be my own.</p>

                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>Did your Merit get none? I am afraid then your Trumpet sounds False; there was certainly never any Age so unhapy to have none in it that could distinguish Right?</p>

                  <p>You are not <hi>Radamanthus,</hi> I hope, you are so nicely strict in the way of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? What I said was according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon liberty of Speech: When I said there were none that had Judgment enough to praise me, I meant in comparison of those who wanted it.</p>

                  <p>O, I thought you meant so! And should have thought too, you had never heard or read of any Age but your own, if some of your Plays did not shew to the contrary: Do you think all Ages were not alike for that? Was there ever any in which there was not ten thousand Fools to one Judge?</p>

                  <speaker>Ben. Jo.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Ben. Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>That may shew you then, that all Ages are not alike; with how universal an Applause were your Works received; and how small a share had mine, which, deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at least as well?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Suppose you give your self but your due: Did you live in my Time to know that? You do not find me indeed upon Record begging Praise, or hectoring for it: But shall I tell you where was the Difference, it was in the Men, and not in the Times: Never believe but that there were Millions in that and every Age since, who could not discern any Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in my Poems; but I was so far from being concerned for their Praise, that I should have been frighted and look'd narrowly over my Works again to see where I had fallen low enough to please them; and if you escap't it in your Works, you must thank your Stars, and not your Skill: For the Fool must have a great
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:135738:13"/>share in him who desires any share in the Fool, and 'tis not a small one any where that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails for Praise.</p>

                  <p>You may speak big, who had an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> and <hi>Mecoenas</hi> on your side; but I was fain to write for the Fools, and could not get their Money, which I wanted, without their Applause.</p>

                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>You should have writ according to their Capacities then, and made that an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for doing it ill; as I hear some of the Poets in your Nation do now.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>You should have been contented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out both, or do something for them, and not be so unreasonable to expect that a Droll-Judge should commend a good Play.</p>

                  <speaker>Ben. Jo.</speaker>
                  <p>To shew you then that there was a Difference in the Times we lived in, I found my 'Count in it; when I praised my Plays, they lik'd them, though they did not before: You had to do with People to whom silent modest Merit is a thousand Praises; but if, like me, you had dealt with them that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood nothing of it, you must have commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your self, or they would never have known you deserved it.</p>

                  <p>'Tis easy to Philosophise under the Sun shine of <hi>Augustus</hi> Favour; but I was all Poet, and no Philosopher, and wanted good Sack, and the conveniences of Life, which I thought well gained with praising my self to bad Judges, while my Writings did it to the Good.</p>

                  <p>O, the Contradictions that these Wits will maintain! Why there is, nor never was any being Discreet with it; a witty Man will rather lose his Friend than his Jest, and never considers any thing.</p>

                  <p>I cannot tell what a Discreet Man is; but a Discreet Woman is always taken up with Business, or finding fault with them that are not; and not in keeping foolish witty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or any other Diversion.</p>

                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>A very fine Definition you have given of Wit and Discretion! A Witty Man, in your Sense, is a <hi>Jack-pudding</hi> with a Sword by his Side, which he draws at every Body he meets, provoking them to do him what hurt they can; and a Discreet one, is an unfortunate Lump of Clay, who being incapable of tasting any Pleasure, drudges on in his Pack-Horse-Road, and never seeks the Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Diversion, because he knows he cannot taste it.</p>

                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>No 'tis you that give it; I am as far from thinking a heavy, silent Sot, Discreet, as I am from thinking a prating Fool witty: I take Discretion to be first thinking Right, and then Acting accordingly; and Wit, to be putting those Thoughts into Words when there is no occasion for Action; for if both are not the Result of Thought, 'tis neither Wit nor Discretion, but Chance.</p>

                  <p>There you mistake again; 'tis not the Seriousness which People reason with, but the Truth which gives them Weight: Which indeed a Man may with all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity you require, wanting Spirits to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, yet do it Right; but then 'tis a Picture of Reason in dead Colours, which he would certainly give Life to if he could; neither is this any thing to your Purpose, for lowness nor highness of Spirits, are neither es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to Wit nor Folly, but common to both.</p>

                  <p>O, I will stay here, for Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes People indifferent for every thing; yet now I think on't, I have a mind to go back, for it distracts me to think what a Confusion there is among my Servants now I am not there.</p>

                  <p>I thought what was your Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that your Servants can rob you of it.</p>

                  <p>Why may not I be Indifferent about Diversions, Places, and all the Things that take up the Idle People, and yet be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with my Servants? Why, that is part of my Discretion.</p>

                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>That is, 'tis part of your Discretion to be unmoved with every thing that is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and let your Servants take up your Soul.</p>

                  <p>How take up my Soul, if they do things that 'tis impossible to forbear being ngry at?</p>

                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, if they only can cross your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; for nothing can make People angry, but what does that; Anger being only a more ill-natur'd sort of Sorrow?</p>

                  <p>Who do you think can see with Patience the Mischiefs they do among their Things? Or the senseless Mistakes they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit?</p>

                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>They that do not think the breaking of a Glass the Ruin of their Family, nor have Understandings so little distinguish't from those of their Servants, as to fear their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies should reflect upon them.</p>

                  <p>If you go to that, Mr. Poet, I can take the breaking of a Glass with as much Patience as any body, and have been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for it: But the Impertinence of Servants is not to be endured; one comes and teases me for more of one thing, another for more of another, to perform their Office.</p>

                  <p>Why should their want of Reason af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict you, unless you love them?</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Because 'tis troublesome to me, they will take no denial, and make a Noise about my Ears that puts me out of my Senses.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>And why should that Noise put you out of your Senses, any more than the whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Wind, or any other disagreeable one, if it were as indifferent to you? But the Truth is, that as great Souls are almost always Calm, because there is scarce any thing in the World high enough to reach them; yours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys the same Privilege from the contrary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treant, nothing is low enough to touch you, but your Servants, and you shew by your transport of rage at them, that if you had a taste of any thing else, it would move you as much.</p>

                  <p>I should be a fine Fool indeed, if I could be convinc'd by a Wit; I will stay no longer in your scurvy Company.</p>

                  <speaker>Vir.</speaker>
                  <p>I will stay no longer in yours, and that was the reason I ask'd whether you would stay or go; come, will you go?</p>
